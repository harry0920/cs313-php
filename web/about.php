       <p>
          I am a CIT major with a Minor in CS. I love to play soccer and watch it too. My favorite team is Real Madrid. Apart from soccer I am a pretty outdoors person too, hiking, swimming, climbing are some of my other hobbies. Once I graduate I would try and get a job that will give me alot of experience in Web Developement that eventually I will be able to open my own firm.
